# Modality
Modality is a free, open-source, hospitality-oriented booking system, currently in development. It will support significant event complexity, unmatched by any existing open or closed-source solution. 

Modality will support:

* short events (1 evening, 1 day, 1 weekend,...)
* long events (1 month, 6 weeks,...)
* recurring events (daily, weekly, monthly,...)
* full attendance, or partial attendance
* multiple venues
* translation option for international events
* multiple accommodation locations (including onsite accommodation and partner hotels)
* multiple accommodation types (potentially specific to each location)
* shuttles (for example: airport shuttles at beginning and end of events)
* daily shuttles (transport from hotels to the venues)
* parking for different vehicle types
* catering options: multiple meals (breakfast, lunch, supper,...) with multiple diet options (vegetarian, vegan,...) and multiple sittings (first sitting, second sitting,...)
* individual allocation (rooms, sittings,...)
* bulk allocation (with rules to be entered)
* long stays (staff, visitors, residents,...)
* registration features (instant search, filters, modification, cancellation, confirmation,...)
* individual email notifications
* bulk email (newsletters, information letters,...)
* hot target emailing (triggered when specific booking options matched, booking state changes,...)
* multi-stage variable payments (for example: 25% min deposit, then 50% after a cutoff date,...)
* discounts (children, early booking,...)
* detailed statistics

Modality has the potential to support the following:

* event-oriented organisations
* hotels
* shops (time-limited or permanent, with online option)
* cafes/restaurants (time-limited or permanent, with online option)

The Modality server can support single organisations, multiple different organisations, and parent organisations comprising many child/spin-off organisations (each organising their own events)

Modality is entirely modular. Choose all the modules, or just the modules you want (even the events module is optional).


## Why the name?
'Modality' is a fusion of two words, 'modular' and 'hospitality', a nod to both the softwareâ€™s design and purpose.
