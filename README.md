# Modality
Modality is an open-source, Java-based, hospitality-oriented booking system. Multiple organisations, events and properties are supported, together with a wide range of hospitality-related add-ons, such as meals, transport, translation, special needs and more.


## Why the name?
'Modality' is a fusion of two words, 'modular' and 'hospitality', a nod to both the softwareâ€™s design and purpose.


## Key features
* Developed entirely in Java, on both the server-side and client-side
* Uses the same UI toolkit across all clients apps
* Native web, mobile and desktop clients generated from the same codebase
* Fast and lightweight web apps transpiled from Java into pure JS
* A long-life codebase, built ontop of the hyper-stable Java/JavaFX eco-system
* Designed to facilitate strong refactoring support


## Powered by WebFX
[Webfx](https://webfx.dev) provides a unique JavaFX to JavaScript transpiler, powered by GWT, which generates pure JS that runs directly in the browser without a plugin.
