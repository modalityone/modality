# Modality
Modality is an open-source, Java-based, hospitality-oriented booking system. It has been implemented to support significant event complexity, currently unmatched by any existing open or closed-source solution. 

Modality supports:

* organisations (any type, not just hotels)
* fixed- and variable-duration events at multiple locations
* recurring events at multiple locations
* multiple accommodation locations and types
* catering options: meals, meal types, meal times, meal sittings
* transportion to accommodations and events
* translations of events

Modality has the potential to support the following:

* shops (products, billing, stock)
* restaurants
* cafes

Modality is entirely modular. Choose all the modules, or just the modules you want.


## Why the name?
'Modality' is a fusion of two words, 'modular' and 'hospitality', a nod to both the softwareâ€™s design and purpose.


## Key technology features
* Developed entirely in Java, on both the server-side and client-side
* Uses the same UI toolkit across all clients apps
* Native web, mobile and desktop clients generated from the same codebase
* Fast and lightweight web apps transpiled from Java into pure JS
* A long-life codebase, built ontop of the hyper-stable Java/JavaFX eco-system
* Designed to facilitate strong refactoring support


## Powered by WebFX
[Webfx](https://webfx.dev) provides a unique JavaFX to JavaScript transpiler, powered by GWT, which generates pure JS that runs directly in the browser without a plugin.
