# Modality
Modality is a free, open-source, hospitality-oriented booking system, currently in development. It will support significant event complexity, unmatched by any existing open or closed-source solution.

Modality will support:

* short and long events (evenings, days, weekends, weeks)
* one-time and recurring events
* partial and full attendance
* single and multiple venues
* multiple accommodation locations and types
* transport options (parking and shuttles)
* catering options
* multi-stage payments and discounts
* detailed statistics

Modality will be useful for:

* event-oriented organisations
* hotels

The Modality server can support single organisations, multiple different organisations, and parent organisations comprising many child/spin-off organisations (each organising their own events).

Modality is entirely modular. Choose all the modules, or just the modules you want (even the events module is optional).


## Why the name?
'Modality' is a fusion of two words, 'modular' and 'hospitality', a nod to both the softwareâ€™s design and purpose.


## Status
Modality is in early-stage development. We intend to release a functioning MVP by late-2023.


## Key technology features
* developed entirely in Java, on both the server-side and client-side
* uses the same UI toolkit (JavaFX) across all clients apps
* native web, mobile and desktop clients generated from the same codebase
* server powered by [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/)


## Powered by WebFX
[WebFX](https://webfx.dev) provides a unique JavaFX to JavaScript transpiler, powered by GWT, which generates pure JS that runs directly in the browser without a plugin.
