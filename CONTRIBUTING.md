# How to contribute to Modality

Thank you so much for your wish to contribute to Modality! There are many areas where help is needed, and we have listed some suggestions below, but we are also open to your own suggestions.


## Reporting bugs

- **You can report bugs found in [Modality][modality-repo].** Issues are open for Modality, and we will do our best to fix them.


## Fixing bugs

If you find a bug, you can fork [Modality](https://github.com/mongoose-project/modality) and try to fix it.

- **We are accepting pull requests should you wish to submit a bug fix from your fork.**


## Branding

Modality would benefit from a clean and distinctive branding, initially within the app itself, and later extending to associated external artefacts such as the website etc.

- **If you have any Modality branding ideas or drafts, including logo, color palette and font suggestions, you can [send them to us][modality-contactus]. We will be delighted to consider your propositions.**


## Writing JavaDoc

Modality urgently needs useful, well-written JavaDoc.

- **Please [contact us][modality-contactus] if you would like to get involved with this.**


## Writing unit tests

There are currently no unit tests, which is something we need to change as soon as possible.

- **If you are happy to help write some unit tests, please [contact us][modality-contactus].**


## Developing integration tests

There are currently no integration tests. 

- **If you are happy to help develop some integration tests, please [contact us][modality-contactus].**


## Reviewing our documentation

Where our [documentation](https://docs.modality-project.org) is not clear or detailed enough, or where you would like additional documentation for other aspects of Modality that are not planned in the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), please let us know.

- **You can open an issue for this in our [Modality Docs](https://github.com/webfx-project/modality-docs) repository.**
